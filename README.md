# Optical-character-recognition-mnist

This GitHub repository showcases an OCR system built using the MNIST database. MNIST consists of a vast collection of hand-written digits, serving as a benchmark for character recognition. Our project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify and transcribe these handwritten digits into machine-readable text. Explore our codebase to understand how we preprocess data, design neural networks, and fine-tune models to achieve exceptional OCR results.
